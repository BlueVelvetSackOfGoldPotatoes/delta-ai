                <h1>STORY</h1>
                <p class="lead">Hey! My name is Gonçalo and his is Sander. I am a MSc student of Artificial Intelligence at Groningen
                university and Sander is finishing his BSc on AI as well. We want to take what we know from AI as a
                scientific field and teach it to anyone that wants to learn how to program while improving their own
                cognitive capacities. Basically, we want to make you smarter using science. So we've created an educational
                package and called it delta AI or Δ-AI for short. You can hire us to teach it to you, your kids, your company - anyone!</p>

                <h1>CONCEPT</h1>
                <p class="lead">TΔ-AI is a novel educational package aimed at teaching people how to program while also helping
                  people navigate in a world filled with 'mind' traps (e.g. click-bait fake news, insidious marketing campaigns,
                  addictive apps and games, etc).</p>
        
                <p class="column-text">The information from the scientific field of AI can be used as a tool to teach students
                  about learning and thinking in general: simultaneously introducing how the brain works and how to think
                  better. All of this while teaching people the
                  languages of the future: programming languages. This package should supplement 'normal' education or exist in
                  parallel to it. The trifecta-AI approach, or Δ-AI, is then designed considering well established cognitive
                  facts, learning-theory
                  and Artificial Intelligence. The field of AI itself aims at finding solutions to problems, where mathematical
                  generalisability is desirable and optimisation and efficiency are valued highly. It studies intelligence and
                  knoweldge in
                  a very general sense. The underlying theory of the field is invaluable to any person that wants to learn
                  anything. As an educational architecture, Δ-AI reverts back to basics. Before anyone is taught anything they
                  should be taught
                  what it means to learn, how the brain learns and what are the optimal learning strategies - this is the virtue
                  behind Δ-AI: knowing how things can be known. This means subjects like Computational Theory, Logic,
                  Mathematics and Programming
                  are intentionally emphasised in the material. An applied flavour of these fields is taught explicitly as a
                  tool to tackle real life problems by explicitly teaching student's how their own brains work. This is also
                  made possible through
                  incentivising critical thinking (i.e. the analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments
                  to form a reasonable judgment).</p>
