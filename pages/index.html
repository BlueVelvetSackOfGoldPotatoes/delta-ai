        <h2><small>T My name is Gonçalo and his is Sander. I am a MSc student of Artificial Intelligence at Groningen university and Sander is finishing his BSc. We want to take what we know from AI as a scientific field and teach it to anyone that wants to learn how to program while improving their own cognitive capacities. Basically, we want to make you smarter using science.</small>

        <h1>CONCEPT</h1>
        <h2><small>TΔ-AI is a novel educational package aimed at teaching people how to program while also helping people navigate in a world filled with 'mind' traps (e.g. click-bait fake news, insidious marketing campaigns, addictive apps and games, etc). he information from the scientific field of AI can be used as a tool to teach students about learning and thinking in general: simultaneously introducing how the brain works and how to think better. All of this while teaching people the languages of the future: programming languages. This package should supplement 'normal' education or exist in parallel to it. The trifecta-AI approach, or Δ-AI is then designed considering well established cognitive facts, learning-theory and Artificial Intelligence. The latter serves as a pivot point for teaching higher-order thinking in such a manner that scientific analysis and problem solving techniques should become second nature to students while teaching programming techniques that can be deployed in modern workplaces. The field of AI itself aims at finding solutions to problems, where mathematical generalisability is desirable and optimisation and efficiency are valued highly. It studies intelligence and knoweldge in a very general sense. The underlying theory of the field is invaluable to any human that wants to learn anything. As an educational architecture, Δ-AI reverts back to basics. Teaching foundational precursors to thinking (not just thinking, but thinking better). Before anyone is taught anything they should be taught what it means to learn, how the brain learns and what are the optimal learning strategies - this is the virtue behind Δ-AI: knowing how things can be known. This means subjects like Computational Theory, Logic, Mathematics and Programming are intentionally emphasised in the material. An applied flavour of these fields is taught explicitly as a tool to tackle real life problems by explicitly teaching student's how their own brains work. This is also made possible through incentivising critical thinking (i.e. the analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments to form a reasonable judgment).</small>
